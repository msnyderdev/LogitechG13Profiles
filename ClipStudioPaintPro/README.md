# Logitech G13 Keyboard Profiles for Drawing in Clip Studio Paint Pro

This profile only contains M1, and I intentionally left the third line empty, so we could add shortcuts for our own frequently used brushes.

This profile contains 2 versions: ClipStudioPaintPro (Win).xml and ClipStudioPaintPro (Win-Capslock-Ctrl).xml. The only difference between them is Win-Capslock-Ctrl version swapped "Capslock" key and "Left Control" key for people use their keyboard like this on Windows.
