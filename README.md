# Logitech G13 Keyboard Profiles

One day, I was hanging around in Amazon. Then I found this small but extream handy keyboard. Although it is designed for gaming, with 22 programable keys and 3 modes, I can easily put all the keys for gaming on it (of course...), or map most shortcuts of some softwares to it. This sometimes becomes very helpful. For example, when using photoshop, I don't need to reach the full keyboard while using Wacom tablet anymore. But very unfortunately, Logitech only provides key mapping for games, so I decide to share mine.
